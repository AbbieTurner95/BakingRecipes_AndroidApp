# Baking_App

Udacity Project 3 - Baking Application [In Testing]









**Project Overview**

You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

**Why this Project?**

As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

**What Will I Learn?**

*In this project you will:*

* Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage a third-party library in your app.
* Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.



**Libraries Used**

* [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit) 
* [ExoPlayer](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer)  
* [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso/index.html)
